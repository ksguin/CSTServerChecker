# CSTServerChecker

The app is useful to check the running status of a server once connected to a Wi-Fi.
The user can enter an IP to check the status of the server.
It also allows the user to save an IP so that he/she doesnâ€™t have to enter the IP again & again and can directly check the status of the server by selecting the required IP.
